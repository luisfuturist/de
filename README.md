## Documentation

### Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have:

- A computer with UEFI firmware (legacy BIOS not supported)
- At least 8GB of RAM and 128GB of free storage
- A USB drive with at least 2GB capacity (will be formatted)
- Stable internet connection for downloading packages
- [Curl](https://curl.se/) installed on your current system

### Installation Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read this documentation on a separate device** (phone, tablet, or another computer) as you'll need to reboot during installation and won't have access to this documentation.

> [!CAUTION]
> This installation will completely replace your current system. **Back up all important data before proceeding.**

#### Phase 1: Prepare Installation Media

1. **Download and prepare the installation:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://de.luisfuturist.com | bash prepare
   ```

   This script will:
   - Download Arch Linux ISO
   - Install Ventoy USB tool
   - Format your USB drive
   - Copy the ISO to the USB drive
   - Reboot the system

2. **Configure BIOS/UEFI settings:**
   - Before the computer is about to boot, enter BIOS/UEFI setup (usually F2, F12, or Del key)
   - Ensure that the USB drive is set as the first boot device
   - Disable Secure Boot if enabled
   - Save settings and exit

#### Phase 2: Install Base System

1. **Connect to the internet:** e.g. using WiFi or Ethernet cable

2. **Boot from USB and install Arch Linux:**

   After booting from the USB drive, run:

   ```bash
   archinstall
   ```

3. **Configure installation with these specific settings:**

   Follow the `archinstall` prompts and use these **required** configurations:

   - **Profile Type:** `desktop`
   - **Desktop Environment:** Select `Hyprland` from the window manager options
   - **Audio:** `pipewire`
   - **Kernel:** `linux`, `linux-zen`
   - **Network configuration:** `NetworkManager`
   - **Graphics driver:** `nvidia (proprietary drivers)`
   - **Additional packages:** Leave default or add any specific packages you need

   > [!TIP]
   > For all other settings, the defaults are generally appropriate, but ensure you:
   > - Set a strong root password
   > - Create a user account with sudo privileges
   > - Configure your disk partitioning carefully

4. **Complete base installation:**
   - Wait for the installation to complete (this may take 10-30 minutes)
   - Remove the USB drive when prompted
   - Reboot the system

#### Phase 3: Install Desktop Environment

1. **Complete the desktop environment setup:**

   After rebooting into your new Arch system, log in and run:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://de.luisfuturist.com | bash install
   ```

   This will install and configure:
   - All desktop environment components (Hyprland, Waybar, etc.)
   - Development tools (Cursor, Neovim, Git, Docker, etc.)
   - Essential applications (Chrome, Alacritty, VLC, etc.)
   - Custom themes and configurations
   - System utilities and scripts

2. **Post-installation:**
   - The script will automatically configure your shell
   - Restart your system to apply all changes
