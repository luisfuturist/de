## Installing

Before you can start the development mode, you need to prepare the configuration files.

```bash
salmo prepare
# bash ~/GitHub/9aia/salmo/src/scripts/salmo/salmo prepare
```

This will copy the configuration files to the `~/.config/` directory.

## Development Mode

To start the development mode, run the following command:

```bash
salmo dev
# bash ~/GitHub/9aia/salmo/src/scripts/salmo/salmo dev
```

This will watch for changes in the `config/` directory and apply them to the system.
