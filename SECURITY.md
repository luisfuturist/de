# Security Policy

The security of your data and the integrity of our platform are absolute priorities. We are deeply committed to protecting your information and providing a secure online environment for all our users.

This `SECURITY.md` file outlines the process for reporting security vulnerabilities and details our supported versions.

## 1. Reporting a Vulnerability

Community collaboration is essential for our security. We greatly appreciate your responsible disclosure and value the contributions of security researchers, ethical hackers, and technology enthusiasts.

If you discover a security vulnerability in any part of the DE project, please **do not create a public issue**. Instead, **report it immediately** to the email [security@luisfuturist.com](mailto:security@luisfuturist.com).

In your email, please include the following information:

* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* Clear steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any relevant screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code.
* An assessment of the potential impact.
* Your contact information for follow-up.
* If you can provide a patch or a suggested fix, it will be greatly appreciated, but it is not mandatory.

We value the contributions of the security community to keep Thal secure. All legitimate reports will be thoroughly investigated and addressed with appropriate urgency.

## 2. Supported Versions

To ensure maximum security, only the **latest production version** of Thal is officially supported and receives continuous security updates.

* **Preview and Older Versions**: Pre-release versions and versions older than the latest production release may contain known vulnerabilities and are not actively maintained for security purposes. We will try our best to support them, but we cannot guarantee it. We encourage you to update to the latest version.

## 3. Security Updates

We will try our best to release security updates regularly to fix vulnerabilities, enhance protections, and implement new security measures.

## 4. Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of this project, we recommend reviewing the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and other trusted security resources.

## 5. Our Commitment and Acknowledgements to You

Our commitment to you:

* **Prompt Acknowledgment**: We commit to acknowledging receipt of your report as soon as possible, generally within **1 business day**.
* **Collaboration and Resolution**: We will work with you to validate and resolve the issue with appropriate urgency. We will keep you informed of our progress.
* **Recognition**: We will grant due credit for your contribution, if desired and after the vulnerability has been fixed, in a dedicated contributors section of the project.
